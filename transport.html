					<h2>Public Transport in Vienna</h2>
					<p>
						Vienna features an impressive public transport system. the subway, trams and buses assure reliable and clean transportation.
						The underground/subway system is particularly easy to navigate. At night, there exists a network of night buses, a
						cheaper alternative to taking a taxi. All of these transport options are available at very reasonable prices ranging
						from Euro 1.80 for a single Journey, Euro 14.00 for a weekly card and Euro 49.50 for a monthly ticket.

						<h3>Underground</h3>
						<!--COPYWRIGHT https://www.virtualvienna.net/living-in-vienna/car-transportation/public-transportation/ -->
						<p>The fastest and easiest way to get around especially in the center, is to use one of the five underground lines. Though
							the numbers go up from U1 to U6 easily distinguishable by their separate coloration there is currently no U5. This
							is due to the fact that the U5 has initially been planned, but never been built, though there are plans to realize
							the U5 within 2020. The underground lines are neatly arranged and a solid way to get around the city without having
							to care about weather issues or traffic turbulences and cover all important spots in the inner city.</p>

						<h3>Tram</h3>
						<!--COPYWRIGHT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Vienna-->
						<p>Trams in Vienna (German: Wiener Straßenbahn, in everyday's speech also Bim or Tramway) are a vital part of the public
							transport system in Vienna, capital city of Austria. In operation since 1865, the network reached its greatest extent
							during the interwar period (1918–1939). Today, it is the fifth largest tram network in the world,[2] at about 176.9
							kilometres (109.9 mi) in total length and 1,071 stations.</p>

						<h3>Bus services</h3>
						<!--COPYWRIGHT https://www.virtualvienna.net/living-in-vienna/car-transportation/public-transportation/-->
						<p>Buslines take you to any place you cannot reach with the underground lines, but especially in the outer areas it is
							import to check the last departure times, because the busses might not come in as regularly as in the center of the
							city.

						<h3>Taxi</h3>
						<!--COPYWRIGHT https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g190454-s304/Vienna:Austria:Taxis.And.Rental.Cars.html-->
						<p> In Vienna all taxis are metered - if one does not have a meter do not ride in it (exception is car services). Legitimate
							taxis will also have the letters TX at the end of their license number. Most find the taxis to be relatively inexpensive
							when compared to other major cities. Drivers are courteous ( 99%). Taxis can be found at convenient taxi stands throughout
							the city, usually near shopping, major tourist sites, transport transfer points etc. Of course, the word "Taxi" found
							on their roof.
