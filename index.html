				<p>Vienna, also described as Europe's cultural capital, is a metropolis with unique charm, vibrancy and flair. It boasts
					outstanding infrastructure, is clean and safe, and has all the inspiration that you could wish for in order to discover
					this wonderful part of Europe. Vienna, the capital of Austria, 2 million inhabitants, is situated on the banks of the
					Danube. The influx of visitors from all over the world has made Vienna the most popular urban tourist destination in
					Austria. Vienna is a dream city for anyone with a romantic streak or an interest in history. Sightseeing opportunities
					are to be found in abundance.

					<p>I had a one year internship in Vienna. It was the best experience in my life. I made the decision to relocate to the
						capital Austria, and have been living here for the last four years now.

				<h3>World's top city for quality of life</h3>

				<p>Vienna, Austria's grand capital on the Danube river, has topped consulting firm Mercer's list of cities offering the
					highest quality of life for the eighth year in a row, while Baghdad is again considered the worst place to live. The
					survey of 231 cities helps companies and organisations determine compensation and hardship allowances for international
					staff. It uses dozens of criteria such as political stability, health care, education, crime, recreation and transport.
					Vienna's inhabitants benefit from the city's cafe culture and museums, theatres and operas. Rents and public transport
					costs in the city, whose architecture is marked by its past as the centre of the Habsburg empire, are cheap compared
					with other western capitals.
